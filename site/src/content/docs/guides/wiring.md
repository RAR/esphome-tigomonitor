title: Wiring Guide

You're connecting three wires — **A**, **B** and **ground** — between your Tigo
equipment and the ESP32 board, so the board can quietly listen in on the
conversation your panels are already having. Written for solar owners doing it
themselves.

The wiring itself is genuinely simple. The care is all in step zero: making the
high-voltage side safe before you open anything.

> ⚠️ **Warning — this bus lives inside a high-voltage PV system.**
> The RS485 *signal* is low voltage, but you tap it inside or next to a Tigo CCA/TAP and inverter that are part of a **high-voltage PV DC system**. That DC can be **lethal**, and it is **not** switched off just because you turn the inverter off — sunlit panels keep producing voltage.
>
> Before opening any enclosure:
> - **De-energize and isolate the PV array and inverter** using the DC disconnect / isolator, per your inverter's shutdown procedure. Turning off the inverter alone does **not** make the array safe.
> - **Treat the inverter side as live high-voltage DC** until you have verified it is isolated.
> - **If you are not comfortable or qualified, stop** and involve a licensed solar installer or electrician. There is no shame in it and it may be a legal requirement where you live.

## Where it goes

Your optimizers talk to your Tigo CCA (the green wall box) or TAP (the small radio
box) over a **four-wire** cable — **+** and **−** carrying power, **A** and **B**
carrying the data. That data pair is RS485, and it's the only part we're interested
in. You're splicing the ESP32 into the existing run — at the CCA's **GATEWAY**
port — so it hears both sides of the conversation without joining in.

**Tap A and B only, plus a ground.** Leave the power pair connected exactly as you
found it. The terminals are marked on the port; the diagram below shows the order.

Think of it as a wiretap, not a phone extension.

The ESP32 acts as a **passive listener** – it only receives, and it is wired so that it *physically cannot* transmit onto the bus. See [Passive-listener wiring](#why-this-cannot-break-your-solar-system) below for the electrical reason why.

### M5Stack AtomS3R + Atomic RS485 Base

The Atomic RS485 Base plugs directly onto the AtomS3R. Connect RS485 terminals:

```

TX is wired but inert — the transceiver's driver is held disabled, so the ESP32 only listens. See [Why this is read-only](#why-this-cannot-break-your-solar-system).

### Wiring Table

| Connection | From | To |
|------------|------|-----|
| RS485 A | CCA/TAP A terminal | RS485 Base A terminal |
| RS485 A | RS485 Base A terminal | Optimizer bus A |
| RS485 B | CCA/TAP B terminal | RS485 Base B terminal |
| RS485 B | RS485 Base B terminal | Optimizer bus B |
| GND | CCA/TAP GND | RS485 Base GND |

**Note:** RS485 A and B are daisy-chained through the ESP32 module. The ESP32 monitors traffic in both directions.

**Ground reference:** RS485 needs a **common ground reference** between the ESP32 and the Tigo bus for reliable signalling — connect GND. It is not optional. (Skip it only if the ESP32 and the Tigo equipment already share a ground through another path, and even then a dedicated GND wire is the safer default.)

### Why this cannot break your solar system

Short version: the chip that would let the ESP32 speak on the cable has its
"talk" switch wired permanently off. Not off in software, where a bug could flip
it — off in the wiring, where nothing can. The ESP32 can shout all it likes and
not a single volt reaches your solar equipment.

If you want the electrical detail:

The AtomS3R UART wires TX to GPIO6, and the MAX485 example below wires the driver input (DI) to that same TX pin — yet the ESP32 still **cannot** transmit onto the bus. Here's why:

- A MAX485-style transceiver only drives the A/B lines when its **driver-enable (DE)** pin is HIGH and its **receiver-enable (RE)** pin is LOW.
- In every wiring here, **DE and RE are tied LOW**. That holds the driver **permanently disabled** — its A/B outputs are high-impedance no matter what TX/DI does.
- So wiring TX/DI is harmless: with the driver disabled, whatever the ESP32 sends on TX simply goes nowhere. The receiver stays enabled and you listen only.

This is what guarantees passive, read-only operation — it's the disabled driver, not an unwired TX pin.

## Safety Notes

> ⚠️ **Warning — high-voltage PV DC.**
> - **De-energize and isolate the PV array and inverter before opening any enclosure or touching wiring.** PV DC can be **lethal** and is **not** switched off by turning the inverter off — panels in daylight keep producing voltage.
> - **Treat the inverter side as live high-voltage DC** until you have confirmed isolation with the proper disconnect.
> - **If you are not comfortable or qualified, involve a licensed solar installer or electrician.**

Once the high-voltage side is safely isolated:

- The RS485 **signal** is low voltage (typically 5V differential), but verify your system before assuming anything is safe to touch.
- Connect a **common GND** between the ESP32 and the Tigo bus so RS485 has a shared reference.
- The ESP32 is passive – with the transceiver's driver disabled (DE/RE tied LOW) it physically cannot transmit, so it cannot interfere with Tigo operation.

## Example Setups

### M5Stack AtomS3R + Atomic RS485 Base

Simplest setup – just plug together and connect RS485 terminals:

1. Attach AtomS3R to Atomic RS485 Base
2. Connect A terminal to Tigo RS485 A (daisy-chain)
3. Connect B terminal to Tigo RS485 B (daisy-chain)
4. Power via USB-C
5. Flash ESPHome configuration

### ESP32-DevKit + MAX485 Module

Budget option:

1. Wire MAX485 VCC to ESP32 3.3V
2. Wire MAX485 GND to ESP32 GND
3. Wire MAX485 RO to ESP32 GPIO5 (RX)
4. Wire MAX485 DI to ESP32 GPIO6 (TX)
5. **Tie MAX485 DE and RE to GND** — this disables the driver and is what makes the ESP32 read-only (step 4 is then harmless; see [Why this is read-only](#why-this-cannot-break-your-solar-system))
6. Connect A/B to Tigo RS485 bus, and share a common GND with the bus

The UART runs at **38400 baud, 8N1** on TX=GPIO6 / RX=GPIO5.
